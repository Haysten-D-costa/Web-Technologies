	   Music is the art form that combines rhythm and sound to form a functional melodic line. Music itself transcends time, space, and cultures. Music can carry a mood without speaking any specific words...
	   It can also be captured and recorded in a written universal language unique unto any other art form.<br>
	   The history of music is a lengthy topic which requires much depth and time. Music is an ancient art form that began during prehistoric times.<br><br>
	   It carries with it a history for each human culture throughout time. 
	   Although there are many varied definitions of music, it is a cultural universal because every culture throughout time and history has made music a primary component of life. For ages, music was passed down through oral tradition on a fundamental level; 
	   but for formal purposes, recorded music began with the written tradition by medieval monks during 500 AD to 1400.<br>
